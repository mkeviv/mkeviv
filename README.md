### Things I am planning to work on :
- [ ] Create a audio matcher
  - [ ] Read Shazam/Scientific papers on audio matching
  - [ ] Research about more clone implemetation (revisit FT, FFT, time , frequency domain etc)
  - [ ] Make a design for the app implementing TDD
  - [ ] Read about implementation by [Roy van Rijn](https://www.royvanrijn.com/blog/2010/06/creating-shazam-in-java/) and available repos like [audio matcher](https://github.com/wsieroci/audio-recognizer)
  - [ ] Do the implementation in Rust if POC works (to learn Rust)
  - [ ] To add further steps after above

- [ ] Crafting Interpreters Book implemetation
  - [ ] To add further steps here after primary research

- [ ] Java concurrency in practice book implementation
  - [ ] To add further steps here after primary research
